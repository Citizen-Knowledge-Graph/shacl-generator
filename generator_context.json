    "Generated constraints that rely on an existing datafield must comply with the datatype associated with that datafield. E.g. ff:einkommen_neu has datatype xdf:string with the additional constraint that the required value has be one of the available answer options. The field constraint can never be an integer.",
    "If you have a requirement that is conceptually similar to an existing datafield but none of the available answer option directly correspond to the requirement, create an entirely new datafield.\n\nAn example:\nff:einkommen_neu relates to income but needs to be selected from one of the available answer options.\nif the requirement states that a person cannot earn more than 1500 euro per month this relates to income but the figure does not correspond to one of the available answer options. here you need to create a new datafield for income that can hold numerical values."
